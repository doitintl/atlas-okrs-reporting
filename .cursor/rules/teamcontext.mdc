## Team context
We only care about the goals of the people within the EMEA team, the ones that we have in the @teams.csv or in the table `okrs_dataset.teams`

## Goals Sanity check 
For a goal to be completely healthy it nees to bring:
- ✅ A descriptive name 
- 📅 A Due Date (monthly preferred)
- 📈 A Progress Metric (manual or automatic)
- 👤 A single Owner 
- 🌳 A Lineage (in dot notation e.g. doit.cs.cre.emea.south.es-pod-1)
- 🏷️ Tags
-  📌 Start Date (optional but recommended specially for those goals starting in the feature)
- 🧭 Goal owner team's name as the team field
